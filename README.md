Bayesian Optimization using Histogram Intersection Kernel


This is an R implementation of Bayesian Optimisation with HIK.
The optimization process depends on many parameters that have to be selected carefully in order to balance speed and potential for reaching better solutions.

The file also includes two examples, which where used to create the plots in the publication:
