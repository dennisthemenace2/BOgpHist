Bayesian Optimization using Histogram Intersection Kernel


This is an R implementation of Bayesian Optimisation with HIK.
The optimization process depends on many parameters that have to be selected carefully in order to balance speed and potential for reaching better solutions.
Therefore, this is mostly an experimental implementation, but fully working.

The file also includes two examples.
